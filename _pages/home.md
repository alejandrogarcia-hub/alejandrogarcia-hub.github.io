I am a Computer Scientist passionate about building and leading end-to-end software solutions.
I have broad practical experience in software engineering, AI/ML, leading teams, project managment as well as coordinating multidisciplinary teams. I am working on leading a mandate to design, architect and implement AI solutions across business units.

I have extensive experience in multiple domain areas, E-Commerce, Fintech, Enterprise Banking, IoT and RegTech. Having been responsible for developing comprehensive machine learning, data, analytics, and integration strategies in complex business environments.

I can define and execute strategic visions and create disruptive solutions that align with core long term business objectives.
